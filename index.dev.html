      <h1>How to use this app</h1>

      <p>This app has been designed for use while playing, requiring one person to keep
        score as players reveal tiles and declare wins. Each player has five sets that
        can be filled out while playing, using the numbers 1 through 9 for numeric tiles
        and the letters [e], [s], [w], [n], [c], [f], and [p] for the four winds and the
        three dragons. For numeric tiles, the suits are indicated with the suit buttons
        next to the input field (these will automatically "click" if you type a numeric
        hand with a suit letter anywhere in it; suit letters are "c", "b", and "d" for
        characters, bamboo, and dots respectively). To mark a set as concealed, use the
        "..." button, or use the "!" character in the input field to toggle visibility.</p>

      <p>To score a hand after someone has declared a win, simply make sure all tiles
        have been chronicled, and that the winner's special win conditions have been
        marked. Then hit the "score" button, and the app should score everyone, process
        the balances, and move the app over to the next turn, with the winds rotated
        appropriately.</p>

      <p>If a player declares a win without having a winning hand, the "illegal win
        declaration!" button can be used. This processes the associated penalty and
        resets the hand. Should a player commit a "nine tile error", click its button
        for the offending player, then score hands regularly. The scoring algorithm
        will take the nine tile error into account.</p>

      <p>Limit hands are not automatically detected - you will have to pick the
        appropriate limit hand from the list of limit hands for the winning player.</p>

      <p>Scores are listed below the main UI area, <strong>newest score on top</strong>
        with the scores arranged in the same order as the players are. By default only
        the total number of points won/list per hand are shown, but these values can be
        clicked to reveal detailed win/loss information such as hand tiles, points for
        patterns, doubles, etc.</p>

      <p>If you want to start a game with scores and winds written down from some previous,
        unfinished game, you can use the "Advance hand" button to move the game forward
        until you get the right combination (it looks disabled; it is not). In order to
        set the scores to what they were in your old game, click the player's score and
        type in a new number. If you do this by accident, cancel or OK will both leave
        the score as it was before. The number of wins can be changed in the same way.</p>

      <p>The app currently only supports Chinese Classical rules, however the code has
        been structured in such a way as to allow additional rulesets to be encoded
        without having to fiddle with any other aspects of the app. If you are interested
        in helping write additional rulesets, head on over to the <a href="http://github.com/Pomax/mjscoring.js">github
        project page</a> and file an issue for the ruleset you wish to help with,
        or hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/TheRealPomax">twitter</a>. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
